## Introduction
The "external vehicle condition detection" (EVCD) project aims to improve road traffic safety and reduce the number of traffic accidents. The project offers a solution for monitoring the condition of vehicles and provides feedback on the observed vehicle condition based on the observed data. This version uses machine vision and artificial intelligence tools (object recognition, object classification) to provide a unique solution for determining the tire pressure level of vehicles. The system can easily be integrated as an endpoint to observation system sensors, such as road cameras, public surveillance systems. The project was a finalist in the BME TMIT IoT + AI competition in 2022 and also won the audience award.
